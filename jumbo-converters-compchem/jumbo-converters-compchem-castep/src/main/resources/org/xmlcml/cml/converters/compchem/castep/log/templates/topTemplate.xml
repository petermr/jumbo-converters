<!--  this is the top template file for Castep log files.
It should generally be found in the directory structure
  src/main/resources/org/xmlcml/cml/converters/compchem/castep/log
It uses include files from 
  src/main/resources/org/xmlcml/cml/converters/compchem/castep/log/templates
  (though I am not quite sure why the subdirectories are not explcit here)
  
The ORDER of the subtemplates may be important. Templates are processed in the order 
  in this files and the subtemplates. Some of the files are marked with comments
